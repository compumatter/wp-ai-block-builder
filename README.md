WordPress AI Block Builder 
This is a first effort at trying to create a system for building WordPress Blocks that follow a Single Source Of Truth methodology. Too often when creating WordPress blocks using standard AI tools we inevitably end up with duplicate code everywhere making it a nightmare to modify.  We want css centralized, js centralized, html structure centalized etc... Of course we still want to be able to tell AI to create a block that does whatever it is you want it to do,  just keep the structure consistent.
